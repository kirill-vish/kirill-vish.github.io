My name is Kirill, and I'm currently an AI Engineer at <a href="https://ruya.ai/">Ruya AI</a>. Before that I worked as a Research Engineer for AI in Genomics at <a href="https://m42.ae/">M42</a>, a global tech-enabled healthcare company, developing genomic foundation models. 

I obtained MSc in Computer Vision at MBZUAI, where I worked in the <a href='https://mbzuai.ac.ae/research/research-center/ciai/'>Center of Integrative Intelligence</a> (CIAI) with <a href='https://zhiqiangshen.com'>Dr. Zhiqiang Shen</a> and <a href='https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/professor-eric-xing/'>Prof. Eric Xing</a>. During my time at MBZUAI I was also fortunate to work with <a href='https://liuzhuang13.github.io/'>Dr. Zhuang Liu</a> from Meta AI Research. 

Aside from my academic pursuits, I sometimes participate in different machine competitions and achieved rank of a Kaggle Competition Master.
