My name is Kirill, and I am currently a Research Associate for AI in Genomics at G42 Healthcare, a global tech-enabled healthcare company. I obtained MSc in Computer Vision at MBZUAI, where I worked in the <a href='https://mbzuai.ac.ae/research/research-center/ciai/'>Center of Integrative Intelligence</a> (CIAI) with <a href='https://zhiqiangshen.com'>Dr. Zhiqiang Shen</a> and <a href='https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/professor-eric-xing/'>Prof. Eric Xing</a>. During my time at MBZUAI I was also fortunate to work with <a href='https://liuzhuang13.github.io/'>Dr. Zhuang Liu</a> from Meta AI Research. My research interests primarily focus on deep learning, computer vision and AI in genomics. Before joining MBZUAI, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from St.Petersburg Polytechnic University and worked at Soter Analytics as Data Scientist where I helped to develop ergonomic solutions and wearable devices. 

Aside from my academic pursuits, I sometimes participate in different machine competitions and achieved rank of a Kaggle Competition Master.
